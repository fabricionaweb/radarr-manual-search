Bash script to ask Radarr to _manual_ search (full search) over a limited amount of items.

Do it to look for upgrades that may have be missed on RSS, changed a Custom Profiles, or added a new indexer.

Set a cron to run it once a day, and use with moderation.

It will apply the defined tag after each search and it wont search again, until you manually removes the tag.
